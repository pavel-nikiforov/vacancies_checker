vacancies_checker
=================

Everyone loves [HeadHunter.ru] (http://hh.ru/)  
The site holds leading position on job search market in Russia  
Unfortunately search results based on job area (like IT->Testing)  
contain a lot of unrelated vacancies.  
Say, if you are looking for a SW Test Engineer opportunity  
the search result will contain vacancies for developers, DBAs, 
support engineers and so on.  

Let's filter the unrelated vacancies out!

If a vacancy name contains a keyword like 'QA', 'Test'
or 'Quality' - we accept it.
